About these documents
*********************

These documents are generated from `reStructuredText
<http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html>`_ sources by `Sphinx
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_, an excellent document processor
specifically written for the Python documentation by Georg Brandl and
contributors.

Development of this documentation and its toolchain takes place on the
grok-dev@zope.org mailing list.  We're always looking for volunteers
wanting to help with the docs, so feel free to send a mail there!

Many thanks go to:

* the `docutils <http://docutils.sf.net/>`_ project for creating
  reStructuredText and the docutils suite;
* Georg Brandl for his `Sphinx` package.

See :ref:`reporting-bugs` for information how to report bugs in Grok
itself.

.. including the ACKS file here so that it can be maintained separately

It is only with the input and contributions of the Grok community
that Grok has so much documentation -- Thank You!


The Grok documentation toolchain
================================

Grok now makes use of the ``Sphinx`` package, which was written by
Georg Brandl and volunteers, to generate the official Python
documentation. Sphinx is able to generate HTML as well as LaTeX and
other formats.


How can I generate nice HTML/LaTeX/PDF documentation for Grok?
--------------------------------------------------------------

If you have run ``bin/buildout``, than you're nearly finished. This
will generate some scripts in the ``bin/`` directory. Just run::

  $ bin/grokdocs2html

to generate the HTML documentation. The docs will be placed in

  docs/build/html/

For LaTeX/PDF docs you must have LaTeX and ``pdflatex`` installed. Then, to generate PDF docs, run::

  $ bin/grokdocs2pdf

which will first generate .tex files and appropriate Makefiles in
``docs/build/latex`` and afterwards run ``pdflatex`` to generate PDFs.

If everything works smoothly three documents will be generated:

1) The Tutorial (``tutorial.pdf``)

2) The Reference (``reference.pdf``)

3) The whole documentation (``grokdocs.pdf``)

which can be found in ``docs/build/latex``.

Any warnings during the document processing can be ignored for the
time being.

The ``grokdocs2...`` scripts generated in ``bin/`` unfortunately yet
do not accept much options. In fact they accept no options at all. But
you can use the also generated script ``bin/sphinx-build`` to finetune
parameters or, after running ``grokdocs2...`` change to the ``build/``
directory and run for instance::

    $ make html SPHINXOPTS="-E -a"

to regenerate all docs in HTML format.


How to tweak the layout/settings of the documentation toolchain
---------------------------------------------------------------

Beside passing options to Spinx (see above), the general settings of
documentation generated by ``sphinx`` are settable in a file
``conf.py`` which must be in the source root directory of your
docs. Have a look at ``docs/conf.py`` for deeper insights.

The structure of the HTML entry page is defined in
``build/docindex.template``, which is a template for the Jinja
templating engine used by Sphinx.

The layout details are defined in ``docs/_static/grok.css``.
